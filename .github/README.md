## Description
This plugin will add various options to implement off-canvas sidebars in your WordPress theme using the Slidebars jQuery plugin.

### Overview / Features
*	Add off-canvas sidebars to the left, right, top and bottom of your website
*	Use sidebar areas (widget-ready areas), menu locations or [custom hooks](https://github.com/JoryHogeveen/off-canvas-sidebars/wiki/Actions-&-Filters) to place content into the off-canvas sidebars
*	You can add control buttons with a widget, menu item, [shortcode](https://github.com/JoryHogeveen/off-canvas-sidebars/wiki/Shortcodes) or with [custom code](https://github.com/JoryHogeveen/off-canvas-sidebars/wiki/Theme-setup)
*	Various customisation options and settings available in the Appearances menu

### Compatibility (IMPORTANT!)
The structure of your theme is of great importance for this plugin. Please read the [installation guide](https://wordpress.org/plugins/off-canvas-sidebars/installation/) carefully!!

This plugin should work with most themes and plugins although I can't be sure for all use-cases. At this point it's still a 0.x version...
If the plugin does not work for your theme, please let me know through the support and add a plugins and themes list and I will take a look!

#### Fixed elements (like sticky menu's)
There are known issues with fixed elements and Slidebars. [Click here for more information](https://www.adchsm.com/slidebars/help/advanced-usage/elements-with-fixed-positions/)
I've created two possible solutions for this:

1. Legacy CSS solution. Use basic CSS2 positioning instead of CSS3 transform with hardware acceleration.
2. JavaScript solution. It is slower but still allows the use of hardware acceleration.

### It's not working! / I found a bug!
Please let me know through [support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/off-canvas-sidebars) and add a plugins and themes list! :)  
Or [submit an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/JoryHogeveen/off-canvas-sidebars/issues)
